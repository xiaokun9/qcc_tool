# QEEnable, QEDisable and QECheck are siflash inject vectors used to configure the QE bit.
# QEMask is the value used to mask the response of QECheck to find the QE bit.
# QEValue is used to compare against the masked response of QECheck to determine whether
# or not the QEEnable/QEDisable vectors should be sent.

# This file is required because S25xxxFL and S25xxxFS parts give the same response to the 9Fh
# identification command but have some differences in command set. This file is for use with
# the S25xxxFL parts. In order to set the QE bit on these parts, add 'qspi_config/01_xxxx_fl.inject'
# as a command line argument to nvscmd.exe like so:
#     nvscmd identify -trb 1 -deviceid 4 0 qspi_config\cypress\01_xxxx_fl.inject
