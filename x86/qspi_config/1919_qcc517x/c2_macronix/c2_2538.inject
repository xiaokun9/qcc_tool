# QEEnable, QEDisable and QECheck are siflash inject vectors used to configure the QE bit.
# QEMask is the value used to mask the response of QECheck to find the QE bit.
# QEValue is used to compare against the masked response of QECheck to determine whether
# or not the QEEnable/QEDisable vectors should be sent.
