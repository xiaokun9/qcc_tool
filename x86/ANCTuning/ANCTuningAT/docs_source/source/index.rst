.. ANC Tuning documentation master file

Production Line ANC Tuning
**************************

This document describes a Python Package that provides an example of
the host-side software that communicates with compatible Qualcomm CDA devices devices over a
UART serial link to perform the ANC tuning on the production
line. This code simply shows how the reading and setting of the ANC
parameters can be performed over the COM port to the device - it does
not show how the gain parameters themselves are calculated.
